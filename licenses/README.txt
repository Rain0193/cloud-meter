This directory structure contains licenses for non-ASF software.

The bin/ directory contains license files for 3rd party jars bundled with the binary distribution

The src/ directory contains license files for 3rd party source; it also applies to the binary distribution

Note that the bin/ directory is included in the source distribution because it is needed in order to create the binary distribution

Also note that this directory structure is inhereted from the Apache JMeter project. Following that, software licenses used in Cloudmeter
are also added to either bin, src or both directories.
