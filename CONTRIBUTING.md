# Contributing

Should you find your self at this code base, reading this page, wanting to contribute I have only this to say: Please! 

However here are some of the key points I'd like to stress about this project for me:
* This is as much about actually building something as it is just putting 10,000 into writing software. Which is to say 
I don't know how far this project will go and how long it will stay active. There are a great many things to do, and at the
time of writing I'm the sole author with 2 stars and 75 commits.
